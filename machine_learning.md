# Regression

Imagine a system working like a black box,
that we can feed with some input and observe the corresponding output.
**Regression** and **classification** are two important problems
met in **adaptive filtering** and **supervised machine learning**,
aiming at modeling the behavior of this system and predicting its output.
The main difference between these two problems is the nature of the output:
* in regression, both input and output are numerical values,
scalars or vectors, and we aim at finding the mathematical mapping
which gives the best prediction of the ouput,
in a sense that we will define in the next sections;
* in classification, the output is a **label**
belonging to a finite or countable set,
and we aim at determining the correct label associated with the input.


This first part deals with the problem of regression.
It is divided into three main topics: linear regression, Kalman filters and non-linear regression.
