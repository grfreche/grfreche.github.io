In Fall 2016, I was instructor at Georgia Tech, teaching ECE 3084 - Signals and systems.
This series of documents is inspired by the classes that I gave then.

# Analog signals

## Lecture 1 - Analog definitions

<a href="https://grfreche.github.io/pdfs/Lec1 - Analog definitions.pdf" class="image fit">Read document</a>

## Lecture 2 - Heaviside step function

## Lecture 3 - Dirac delta function

## Lecture 4 - LTI systems and convoltion

## Lecture 5 - Correlation

## Lecture 6 - Periodic signals

In <a href="https://grfreche.github.io/pdfs/AnalogSignals.pdf" class="image fit">this document</a>, we introduce analog signals and systems and we talk about Heaviside step function, Dirac delta function, linear time-invariant systems, convolution, correlation and periodic signals.
