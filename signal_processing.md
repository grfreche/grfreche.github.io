In Fall 2016, I was instructor at Georgia Tech, teaching ECE 3084 - Signals and systems.
This series of documents is inspired by the classes that I gave then.

# Analog signals

In <a href="https://grfreche.github.io/pdfs/AnalogSignals.pdf" class="image fit">this document</a>, we introduce analog signals and systems and we talk about Heaviside step function, Dirac delta function, linear time-invariant systems, convolution, correlation and periodic signals.
